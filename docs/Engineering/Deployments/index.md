# Deployment Strategy

RISTEK services are deployed across multiple targets with various methods depending on what and where we're deploying. For the most part though, our primary deployment methods are

- [Central Infra](./Central-Infra/) for services deployed on VPS servers.
- [Vercel](placeholder) for simpler projects such as [this wiki](/).
